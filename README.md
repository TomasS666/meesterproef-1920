# Deliverables 
In 5 weeks time we're gonna research and develop a front-end application which will demonstrate the enrichment of listening to a song on Spotify, with external embedded content. 

Our goal is to provide a demo where a single user can:
* Login with Spotify credentials
* Configure and control which platforms provide enriching content within the Spotify demo
* Listen to a song 
* Consume the external content while listening to a song
* Persue embeded content to it's source / platform

# External content providers discussed so far

## Social media
* Instagram 
* Twitter

## Videos
* Youtube

## News
* Pitchfork
* The New York Times?
